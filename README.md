# Airlines

Welcome to my application Airlines here you can create a user account, sign in, choose a flight, buy a ticket and check your flight ticket status in the airline section. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'airlines'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install airlines

## Note  
 If none of these commands work above try `forking` this repository and copy from clone or download.
 type `git clone (paste what you have copied)` in your `terminal` and run `bundle install`


## Usage

To get started on your `terminal` run `rails s`.
If those commands do not work you may need to run `rake db:migrate` to build the database first. Then you may be able to run the `localhost` with the command `rails s`. 

```ruby

=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 5.2.3 application starting in development 
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
Puma starting in single mode...
* Version 3.12.2 (ruby 2.6.1-p33), codename: Llamas in Pajamas
* Min threads: 5, max threads: 5
* Environment: development
* Listening on tcp://localhost:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
 
```
You need to see `localhost:3000` this is what you'll need to copy and paste in your desired internet browser. 

### Congrates You've Done It!!!


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
